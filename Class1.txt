How to do excel things?

Hypothetical scenario:

AHEAD OF EVERYTHING:

- Get all data as a CSV file.
- Put the data in order. 
- Sort the data and delete unnecesary data (after day 2).

DIVINE INFLATION RATE:

- Make the divine(3.19+), LEAGUE SPECIFIC DAILY AVERAGE HOURLY DIVINE PRICE INCREASE RATE of day 1 and day 2 (separately), for each league.
- Make the LEAGUE SPECIFIC AVERAGE HOURLY DIVINE PRICE INCREASE RATE by averaging the LEAGUE SSPECIFIC DAILY AVERAGE HOUERLY DIVINE PRICE INCREASE RATE of day 1 and 2.
- Make the AVERAGE HOURLY DIVINE PRICE INCREASE RATE by averaging all LEAGUE SPECIFIC AVERAGE HOUERLY DIVINE PRICE INCREASE RATE.
- Make the AVERAGE PERCENT HOUERLY DIVINE PRRICE INCREASE RATE by:
~ AVERAGE HOURLY DIVINE PRICE INCREASE RATE / DIVINE PRICE HOUR(0).

ITEM PRICE INCREASE:

- Make the LEAGUE SPECIFIC DAILY AVERAGE HOURLY ITEM PRICE INCREASE RATE of day 1 and day 2 (separately), for each league.
- Make the LEAGUE SPECIFIC AVERAGE HOURLY ITEM PRICE INCREASE RATE by averaging the LEAGUE SPECIFIC DAILY AVERAGE HOURLY ITEM PRICE INCREASE RATE of day 1 and day 2.
- Make the AVERAGE HOURLY ITEM PRICE INCREASE RATE by averaging all LEAGUE SPECIFIC AVERAGE HOURLY ITEM PRICE INCREASE RATE.
- Make the AVERAGE PERCENT HOURLY ITEM PRRICE INCREASE RATE by:
~ AVERAGE HOURLY ITEM PRICE INCREASE RATE / ITEM PRICE HOUR(0).
- Make AVERAGE PERCENT HOURLY ITEM TO DIVINE PRRICE INCREASE RATE by:
~ AVERAGE PERCENT HOURLY DIVINE PRRICE INCREASE RATE - AVERAGE PERCENT HOUERLY ITEM PRRICE INCREASE RATE;

ITEM CHOOSING:
- If (AVERAGE PERCENT HOUERLY ITEM TO DIVINE PRRICE INCREASE RATE >= 3%)
{
	- Show the item on the "INVESTMENT WORTHY TAB".
	- Make the AVERAGE ITEM PROFIT PER HOUR by:
	~ (ITEM PRICE HOUR(0) * AVERAGE PERCENT HOURLY ITEM TO DIVINE PRICE INCREASE RATE) ^ SPECIFIC HOUR INTO THE LEAGUE.
	- Make a chart of "AVERAGE ITEM PROFIT PER HOUR".
}
- Else
{
	- Do not do anything.
